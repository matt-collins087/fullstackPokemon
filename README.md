## Instructions

It is reccomended to complete the requirements in an order similar to the outline below:

| ORDER | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Fix Pokemon.jsx. Pass the dummy data from pokemonData.js to PokemonList.jsx as props to help with building out Pokemon.js until you have correctly implemented step 4. |
| 2     | Finish writing the retrieveAllPokemon function in queries.js. This function should query the database for all pokemon. |
| 3     | Finish writing the '/api/pokemon' route. This endpoint should invoke the retrieveAllPokemon function we wrote in step 1. |
| 4     | Fix the getPokemon method in PokemonList.jsx. This method should make a GET request to the server for all pokemon. |
| 5     | Create a '/api/addPokemon' endpoint in server.js. This endpoint should should add a new pokemon to the database(you will need to create a function that will query the DB as well). |
| 6     | Fix the addCaughtPokemon method in PokemonList.jsx. This method should update the pokemonList in state and make a request to the DB to add the new pokemon. You will know if you implemented steps 4, 5, & 6 correctly if when you reload the page, your newly caught pokemon appear in your pokemonList.
